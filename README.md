# Complex Network Exercises
## Overview
The repository contains `Jupyter Notebooks` for several exercises on the topic of <b>complex networks</b>, where various types of networks are generated, explored and manipulated using the `NetworkX` library for `Python`.

### License
The exercises were carried out as assignments for the 2022/2023 '<b>Complex Networks</b>' course at <b>Aalto University</b>. 

The base infrastructure of the notebooks was implemented by the course staff and provided to the students with core pieces of code missing, which had to be filled-in accordingly. The sections of code left to the students are for the most part preceded by a comment stating "YOUR CODE HERE".

## Project Specifications
Each of the exercises has distinct specifications, which are provided inside of each exercise folder.
